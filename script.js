    //   "This work aim to investigates the existence of self-excited and hidden attractors in discontinuous systems involving sliding mode.  The hypersurface plays a critical role in allowing rapid transient responses to dynamic phenomena. To show the effect of a hypersurface on the dynamics of a discontinuous system, we present a simple discontinuous system composed of dissipative linear subsystems with no equilibria. Our results show that the periodic orbit can be completely established within a sliding region. We then proceed to a mathematical investigation into a path to self-excited and hidden attractors involving sliding mode in a discontinuous system composed of dissipative Jerk-like subsystems separated by a hypersurface. A Poincaré return map is developed to incorporate the presence of the hypersurface, providing the necessary conditions in the basis for sliding period-doubling orbits that lead to the sliding chaotic attractor. Our results show that various types of attractors and their coexisting attractors, such as sliding period doubling and chaotic behavior, are successfully captured. Using path-following techniques for discontinuous dynamical systems, the results are verified numerically.",

      "This study explores Riemannian maps in the context of Kähler geometry, focusing on conformal Riemannian maps and their subclasses: conformal anti-invariant, semi-invariant, and slant Riemannian maps. Riemannian maps serve as generalizations of isometric immersions and submersions, offering a framework to transfer geometric structures between manifolds. Key properties, such as harmonicity, geodesicness, and umbilicality, are examined, emphasizing the role of dilation in conformal mappings. Applications and theoretical insights are drawn to elucidate the geometry of source and target manifolds in almost Hermitian and Kähler settings.",

    //   "Although numerous methods have been reported to prepare nanomaterials, there is still a demand for lowering the required preparation time and cost while maintaining suitable material properties for electrochemical energy storage. In this presentation, an overview of our published studies highlights the utilization of cost-effective and simple methods for synthesizing nanomaterials of metal oxides/hydroxides, carbon forms, and conductive polymers. The synthesis methods include microwave-assisted heating, chemical bath deposition, hydrothermal reaction, ball-milling, sonication, electrodeposition, electrospinning, chemical and physical activations, and scree-printing. The relationship between the synthetic parameters and the structural properties is captured using an X-ray diffractometer, scanning electron microscope, transmission electron microscope, and others. The prepared nanomaterials with promising properties have been used to fabricate supercapacitor electrodes in aqueous electrolytes. The electrochemical techniques of cyclic voltammetry (CV), Galvanostatic charge-discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) have been conducted to investigate the electrical charge storage mechanisms. The electrochemical performance of supercapacitors is evaluated in terms of specific capacitance, energy density, and power density. Most of our supercapacitors are built on flexible substrates such as carbon cloth and stainless-steel mesh, facilitating their future integration into smart textiles and portable electronics.",

      "In this talk, we utilize the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock (BHF) method to compute the static properties of neutron stars (NS) at zero temperature. We specifically apply a microscopic equation of state for pure neutron matter (PNM). Three-body forces have also been included at different densities. To accurately replicate the nuclear matter saturation point, we have incorporated recent and realistic two-body nuclear interactions. Specifically, we have used the Argonne V18 and CD-Bonn NN potentials, integrated via the Urbana model, to account for the three-body force. We have calculated the properties of neutron stars by numerically solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkov structure equations. Our results indicate a maximum mass configuration of M = 1.7 ± 0.05 Mʘ (M = 2.12 ± 0.04 Mʘ) when using CD-Bonn (Argonne 18) interaction, respectively. These values are consistent with the observed range of neutron star masses. Furthermore, we have discussed the sensitivity of using modern NN potentials and compared our results with other theoretical predictions and observed data.",

    //   "The improvement of crop yield using plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) represents a sustainable and environmentally friendly strategy to enhance agricultural production over the long term. PGPR are soil bacteria that colonize plant roots and inhabit the rhizosphere, where they can exist as neutral, beneficial or harmful organisms. These beneficial microbes facilitate improved water absorption, suppress pathogenic organisms and enhance nutrient uptake from the soil. In addition, various PGPR species have been identified to mitigate the harmful effects of salinity stress, thereby increasing plant stress tolerance. This lecture discusses some biochemical mechanisms through which PGPR stimulate plant growth including (1) bio-stimulants, including specific phytohormones such as auxins (e.g. indole acetic acid, cytokinin, gibberellic acid, and ethylene); (2) biofertilization, which aids in the uptake of essential nutrients through processes such as biological nitrogen fixation, phosphate solubilization, and siderophore production; and (3) bioprotectants or biocontrol agents, which mitigate plant diseases vis the production of antibiotics, lytic enzymes, and hydrogen cyanide. Furthermore, new approach was employed to increase the efficacy of PGPR, the utilization of He-Ne laser radiation has been recently explored. Laser treatment can enhance the activity of PGPR by stimulating metabolic processes, improving the colonization of plant roots, and promising the expression of beneficial traits in the bacteria. This combination of laser technology and PGPR application holds promise for optimizing plant growth and resilience, particularly in challenging environmental conditions.",

      "At the end of the 20th century, I found myself drawn to the emerging field of green chemistry. It was an exciting time, with a growing focus on sustainability and reducing the environmental impact of chemical processes. Over the past 25 years, I’ve dedicated my research to creating greener, safer, and more efficient ways to approach chemistry. Whether it’s developing non-toxic catalysts, exploring renewable feedstocks, or designing biodegradable materials, my goal has always been to align science with sustainability. A big part of this journey has been my work with chitosan, a natural biopolymer with some truly remarkable qualities: biodegradability, and antimicrobial activity, to name a few. I’ve published over 30 papers on the subject, exploring its potential applications in pharmaceuticals, agriculture, and environmental science. My research has focused on creating innovative materials like drug delivery systems, bioactive coatings, water purification agents, and nano-catalysts for organic transformations. I’ve also worked on modifying chitosan to make it even more efficient and adaptable for specific uses. At its core, my work is about finding sustainable solutions and pushing the boundaries of what this versatile material can do.",
